## :information_source: How It Works

<div align="center">

The application has an array of strings containing various phrases and messages.
When the button is clicked, the application selects a random string from the array and displays it on the page.

The Chinese cookies image represents the idea of finding a random fortune inside a traditional Chinese fortune cookie.

Each click simulates the opening of a new cookie to reveal a different message.
